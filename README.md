## Gameplay
### Objective
2 players compete to eliminate each other in a dynamic arena filled with obstacles and monsters.

### Monsters
There are 4 types of monsters acting as obstacle factors, each represented as dinosaurs with different behaviors:
1. **Random Movement:** Moves randomly around the map.
2. **Wall Phasing:** Can pass through walls.
3. **Shortest Path Finder (Collision):** Uses a graph-search algorithm to find the shortest path to a player when colliding with a wall.
4. **Advanced Path Finder:** Uses a graph-search algorithm to find the shortest path to a player when colliding with a wall and randomly changes directions.

## Assets
We do not own the sprites used in this game. They were sourced from royalty-free websites.
